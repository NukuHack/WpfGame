# VoidVenture - A WPF Platformer Adventure

[![WPF](https://img.shields.io/badge/Powered%20by-WPF-blue)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/)
[![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%23-5.0+-brightgreen)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)

A procedurally enhanced 2D platformer built with C# and WPF, featuring dynamic color systems and modular game architecture. Perfect for learning WPF game development patterns and image manipulation techniques.

Some basic C#, made for some testing and to have fun developing it.
- Most of the code and the entire readme was written by AI so don't expect much
- Some parts may not work or some information might be false ... just like usual AI

## 🤖 Key Features

- **Dynamic Movement System**  
  Smooth 8-directional movement with:
  - WASD/Arrow key controls
  - Momentum-based gravity system
  - Collision detection against tilemaps
  - Directional sprite rotation

- **Advanced Color Engine**  
  Real-time palette swapping system that:
  - Converts images to indexed color formats
  - Maintains 256-color compatibility
  - Supports procedural color randomization

- **Persistent Save System**  
  - Multiple save file support
  - Data serialization with versioning
  - Save file import/export functionality
  - In-game save management UI

- **Modular Architecture**  
  Clean separation of concerns with:
  - `Player` physics/movement class
  - `MathUtils` helper math module
  - `Palette` color management system
  - `Saves` - planned saves
  - Some extra TMX map loading support

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights

**1. Collision Detection System**  
- Tile-based collision using `Rect` intersections with dynamic bounds checking.

**2. Palette-Based Recoloring**  
- Advanced image processing pipeline.

**3. Game Loop Management**  
- 60 FPS update cycle using WPF DispatcherTimer.  
- This is important - if the game can not run at 60 fps the gravity and other movement might break.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Movement**:  
   - Arrow keys or WASD to move  
   - Spacebar for hover ability  
   - ESC to open menu

2. **Menu Controls**:  
   - Load/Save/Delete game progress  
   - Import external save files  
   - Customize game settings

---

## 📦 Getting Started

**1. Clone the repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NukuHack/WpfGame.git
```

**2. Requirements**  
- Visual Studio 2022+ with .NET 5.0 SDK
- WPF development workload installed

**3. Run the game**  
- You could try running the `.exe` file in the `VoidVenture\bin\Debug`, but there is a chance I did not compile it to the latest version  
  in that caseOpen `VoidVenture.sln` and press F5 to build/run
